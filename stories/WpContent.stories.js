In many cases, that means bridging the gap between information and understanding.</p>\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s a multi-faceted company with countless departments or a brand with a story that is a bit more complicated to understand, we&#8217;ve faced a number of projects that require the power of design to take complexities in information and turn it into a digital experience that is easy to understand. It&#8217;s the art of design translation.</p>\n<p>Design gives us the ability to deliver a single solution that addresses a number of factors. When we create a brand strategy that speaks to a client&#8217;s business goals and core differentiators, design will filter pertinent findings and points of communication into the website seamlessly.</p>\n<div class="col"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17760" src="http://api-funkhaus.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/3am-Gif.gif" alt="" width="1421" height="666" /> </div>\n<div class="col">Take, for example, our work for the <a href="https://www.moving-picture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moving Picture Company</a> and <a href="http://www.its3am.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3am</a>—two clients that were in need of websites that could turn an influx of information into an understandable experience. For 3am, this meant crafting an about page that broke down the who, what, where, and why in a manner that was aesthetically pleasing and entirely true to who they are. </div>\n<p>With MPC, we created a site that highlights all of their work and long-lasting industry presence, bringing together different company components and projects into one singular website that comes to life with dynamic navigation, intuitive sharing and sales capabilities, and so much more.</p>\n<div class="col">We worked with <a href="http://api-funkhaus.flywheelsites.com/work/swell-creative-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swell Creative Group</a> to create a website that captured the ins and outs of what they do in advocacy. We wanted users to understand the relevance and enorminity of Swell&#8217;s work from the moment they hit the page. With a homepage that features a rapid-fire loop of hero images that tap into their social and political views or interests to typeface that is straight-forward and direct, every feature tells their story in an exciting and lively manner.</div>\n<div class="col"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15188" src="http://api-funkhaus.flywheelsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Swell-gif.gif" alt="" width="480" height="267" /></div>\n<p>The same goes for <a href="http://api-funkhaus.flywheelsites.com/work/imagine-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Imagine Entertainment </a>. With decades of experience in the entertainment industry, Imagine needed a space on their website to share their legacy with the world. Rather than use blocks of texts or create convoluted pages, we made a timeline that gives users the ability to soak in years of content.</p>\n<p>From interactive features that cater to user flow to personality-driven pages that tell a deeper story, design amplifies our communicative abilities time and time again. Shoot us a line and we&#8217;ll show you how.</p>\n'
